# Nano Experiments

## Introduction
This repository is intended to be a collection of experiments with the [Nano](www.nano.org) cryptocurrency. Since i am still learning myself, many of these projects can be improved, but i'm hoping they might serve as a starting point for others starting to experiment with Nano as well!

## Projects
For now, the following projects are part of this repository:

- [Arduino Point of Sale Prototype](arduino/readme.md)
